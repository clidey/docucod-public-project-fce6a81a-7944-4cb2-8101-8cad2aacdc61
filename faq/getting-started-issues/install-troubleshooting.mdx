# Installation & Setup Issues FAQ

This FAQ provides targeted solutions to common problems encountered during the installation and environment setup of Task. Whether you face platform-specific hurdles, permission errors, or difficulty locating the Task binary after installation, this guide offers clear, practical steps to get you running smoothly.

---

## 1. Common Installation Questions

### 1.1 How do I install Task on my platform?
Task supports a range of platforms including Windows, macOS (darwin), and Linux architectures. Installation typically involves downloading the precompiled Task binary corresponding to your OS and architecture.

To install Task using the official installation script:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)"
```

You can specify the installation directory (default is `./bin`) with the `-b` flag:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -b /usr/local/bin
```

The script automatically detects your OS and architecture to download the appropriate binary.

### 1.2 How do I verify the installation succeeded?
Run:

```sh
task --version
```

If Task is correctly installed and in your PATH, this command will display the installed Task version.

### 1.3 What if my platform is not supported?
The installation script supports major platforms and architectures explicitly listed (e.g., linux/amd64, windows/386, darwin/arm64). If your platform is not supported, the installer will abort with an error.

<Tip>
Make sure your system’s OS and CPU architecture are among the supported values. If your platform is missing, open an issue at https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/new to request support.
</Tip>

## 2. Permission and Environment Setup Issues

### 2.1 I get a permission denied error during installation. How do I fix it?
If you install to a system directory like `/usr/local/bin`, ensure you have the necessary permissions:

- Use `sudo` to run the install script when writing to protected directories.
- Alternatively, install to a user directory like `~/bin` and add it to your PATH.

Example:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -b ~/bin
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

### 2.2 Task binary installed but cannot be found on command line

This usually means the directory where Task got installed is not in your system’s `PATH` environment variable.

- Verify installation directory (default is `./bin` relative to where you ran the script).
- Add this directory to your PATH in your shell configuration, for example in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

- Reload your shell or restart terminal.

### 2.3 Debugging installation issues

The installation script includes a `-d` flag to enable debug logging, which can help uncover where failures occur:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -d
```

This prints detailed info about each step such as download URLs, checksum verifications, and installation paths.

---

## 3. Download and Verification Problems

### 3.1 The installer reports checksum verification failed

The install script verifies the SHA256 checksum of the downloaded binary to ensure integrity. If verification fails:

- Make sure your network connection is stable and download is not corrupted.
- Retry the installation.
- Confirm that the script is up-to-date (re-download the latest install script).
- Check for any proxy or firewall that might alter the downloaded files.

### 3.2 Download errors or unable to connect to GitHub releases

The installer uses `curl` or `wget` to fetch assets. If you see network or HTTP errors:

- Verify your internet connectivity.
- Make sure your environment supports `curl` or `wget` commands.
- If corporate proxies are involved, configure them for your shell environment.

---

## 4. Platform-Specific Issues

### 4.1 Windows installation tips

- The binary installed will be `task.exe`.
- Ensure PowerShell or CMD shell's execution policies allow running the binary.
- Add the installation directory (e.g., `C:\tools`) to the system PATH.
- Use Git Bash or Windows Terminal for better shell compatibility with Task.

### 4.2 macOS and Linux permissions

- Verify execution permissions on the Task binary:

```sh
chmod +x /path/to/task
```

- Confirm your macOS security settings or Linux AppArmor/SELinux policies are not blocking execution.

---

## 5. After Installation: Locating the Task Binary

### 5.1 Where is Task installed by default?
- The default installation directory is `./bin` relative to the directory where you run the install script.
- You can override this with the `-b` flag.

### 5.2 How do I add Task to my PATH?
Add this line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Then reload shell with `source ~/.bashrc` or restart terminal.

### 5.3 How to confirm which Task binary is running

Run:

```sh
which task
# or
command -v task
```

This shows the full path of the executable in use.
