# How to Get Help & Community Support

Welcome to the essential guide on finding help and connecting with the Task community. Whether you are troubleshooting an issue, seeking best practice advice for your Taskfiles, or reporting a bug, this page directs you to the official support channels, community forums, and documentation resources. Our goal is to empower you to get fast, effective support and engage with fellow Task users and developers.

---

## Official Support Channels

### 1. GitHub Issues

The primary platform for reporting bugs, requesting features, or raising concerns is the [Task GitHub repository's Issues page](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues).

- **Best practice for reporting**: Provide detailed Taskfile content snippets, exact Task version (output from `task --version`), OS and environment details, and any error messages.
- **Labeling**: Issues are categorized for quick response, so help the maintainers by choosing the closest matching template.

<Tip>
Be as descriptive as possible and include reproducible steps. This accelerates diagnostics and solution delivery.
</Tip>

### 2. Discussions & Community Forums

For open-ended questions, usage advice, or sharing Taskfile best practices, the repository's [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/go-task/task/discussions) is an excellent venue.

- Ask for help with your Taskfiles
- Share custom workflow tips
- Discuss upcoming features or changes

### 3. Slack and Chat Platforms

While not officially maintained, many users and contributors participate in community chat platforms related to Go, DevOps, and automation, where Task support discussions often take place.

- Search for Task channels in relevant Slack or Discord communities.
- Engage with other users to exchange practical experience.

### 4. Mailing Lists or Newsletters

Currently, Task does not provide official mailing lists, but following the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/go-task/task) and watching the release notes is recommended to stay informed.
