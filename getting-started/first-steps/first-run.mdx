# Your First Task Run

Welcome to your first experience running automation with Task! This guide will take you step-by-step through creating a basic Taskfile, running your first task from the command line, and understanding what success looks like. By the end, you'll master how to execute a simple workflow and interpret Task's output confidently.

---

## 1. Prepare Your Taskfile

Task runs workflows defined in a `Taskfile.yml` (or `.yaml`) file placed in your project root.

1. **Create a minimal Taskfile:**

   This file declares tasks, their commands, and optionally dependencies or descriptions.

   Here is a minimal example that defines a basic task called `hello`:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'

   tasks:
     hello:
       desc: "Print a greeting"
       cmds:
         - echo 'Hello, Task!'
   ```

2. **Save this as `Taskfile.yml` in your project directory.**

   - The filename is case-insensitive but `Taskfile.yml` is the default.
   - Ensure correct indentation and YAML syntax to avoid parsing errors.

<Tip>
You can generate an initial Taskfile skeleton by running `task --init` in an empty folder; however, crafting your first task manually helps you understand the basics.
</Tip>

## 2. Run Your First Task From the Command Line

With your `Taskfile.yml` ready, it's time to execute your task.

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt at your project's root directory (where `Taskfile.yml` lives).**

2. **Run your task by typing:**

   ```bash
   task hello
   ```

   - `task` is the command-line interface.
   - `hello` is the task name from your Taskfile.

3. **Expected output:**

   You should see Task log the command it's running and the command output:

   ```console
   > echo 'Hello, Task!'
   Hello, Task!
   ```

4. **If your task runs successfully:**

   - The terminal prompt returns without errors.
   - The output matches your command's expected results.

<Check>
If you see errors such as "Taskfile not found" or YAML syntax errors, double-check your Taskfile location, name, and formatting.
</Check>

## 3. Understanding What Just Happened

- Task read your `Taskfile.yml` and parsed its tasks.
- It found the `hello` task and executed the listed shell commands sequentially.
- Standard output (`Hello, Task!`) was displayed.
- Tasks can contain multiple commands, dependencies, environment variables, and more.

This simple run confirmed that Task is correctly installed, your Taskfile is structured properly, and the CLI can execute your custom automation.

## 4. Enhancing Your First Task

Try adding these enhancements as next steps to deepen your understanding.

1. **Add descriptions for better clarity:**

   ```yaml
   tasks:
     hello:
       desc: "Prints a friendly greeting"
       cmds:
         - echo 'Hello, Task!'
   ```

2. **Create a default task:**

   If you name a task `default`, it will run when you execute `task` without arguments.

   ```yaml
   tasks:
     default:
       desc: "Default task runs hello"
       cmds:
         - task: hello
   ```

3. **Run multiple commands:**

   ```yaml
   tasks:
     hello:
       cmds:
         - echo 'Starting task...'
         - echo 'Hello, Task!'
         - echo 'Task completed.'
   ```

4. **Try aliases or environment variables** to customize your tasks. All options are documented in the Task docs.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Task Run">
<Accordion title="Taskfile Not Found or Not Loaded">
- Make sure your `Taskfile.yml` is in your current working directory.
- The file must be named `Taskfile.yml`, `Taskfile.yaml`, or supported variants.
- Run `task --version` to verify Task is installed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="YAML Syntax Errors">
- Use a YAML linter or online validator to check your file syntax.
- Common mistakes: missing indentation, tabs instead of spaces, unquoted strings with special chars.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Command Not Executing or Empty Output">
- Verify shell commands are valid in your OS shell environment.
- Run commands independently in your terminal to confirm.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permissions or Environment Variables Not Working">
- Confirm you have execute permissions.
- Check environment variables or credentials needed by commands.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

Now that you have confidently run your first Task:

- Explore writing complex Taskfiles with dependencies, variables, and conditional execution.
- Learn how to use Task's fingerprinting (status checks) to skip unnecessary work.
- Check out [Basic Configuration & Taskfile Structure](/getting-started/configuration-troubleshooting/configuration-basics) for deeper customization.
- Try running included Taskfiles or setting task aliases.
