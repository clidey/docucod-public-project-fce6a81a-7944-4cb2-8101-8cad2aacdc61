# Project Initialization

Learn how to create a new Taskfile using scaffolding, templates, or by hand. This page guides you through setting up your first Taskfile, with YAML-based configuration, to manage your automated workflows effectively.

---

## 1. Understanding the Taskfile

A Taskfile is the heart of Task automation. It defines your repeatable workflows through simple YAML syntax. It lists tasks, commands, variables, environment settings, and dependencies to run tasks efficiently.

By creating a Taskfile, you enable Task to automate steps in your project, from building and testing to deployment.

---

## 2. Creating a New Taskfile

You have three main options to get started with a Taskfile:

### Option A: Scaffold Automatically (Recommended for Beginners)

Use Task’s built-in scaffolding command to create a basic Taskfile tailored to your project needs.

```shell
task init
```

- This command generates a `Taskfile.yml` in your current directory.
- The scaffolded Taskfile includes sample tasks to help you start immediately.

> **Tip:** This method is ideal if you want a quick setup without writing YAML from scratch.

### Option B: Use a Template

You can start from a prebuilt template Taskfile available publicly or from your organization.

Steps:

1. Copy the template Taskfile (`Taskfile.yml` or `taskfile.yml`) into your project root.
2. Adjust variables and commands to fit your environment.

> **Example:** If your team maintains a shared `Taskfile-template.yml`, rename and customize it as your project’s `Taskfile.yml`.

### Option C: Create Manually (For Advanced Users)

If you prefer full control, create a `Taskfile.yml` by hand.

Minimum Example:

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  default:
    cmds:
      - echo "Hello, Task!"
```

This basic Taskfile defines a `default` task that prints a message.

> **Best Practice:** Start simple and incrementally add tasks and features as your project automation grows.

---

## 3. Taskfile Placement and Naming

- Place the Taskfile in your project root for best automatic discovery.
- Supported filenames in prioritized order:
  - `Taskfile.yml`
  - `taskfile.yml`
  - `Taskfile.yaml`
  - `taskfile.yaml`
  - `.dist` variants like `Taskfile.dist.yml` (for template/reference use)

> **Note:** Task walks parent directories looking for a Taskfile if none is found in the current directory.

---

## 4. Editing Your Taskfile

Once created, open the Taskfile YAML and customize:

- **Tasks:** Define commands (`cmds`) that you want to automate.
- **Variables:** Use `vars` for reusable values.
- **Environment:** Set project-specific environment variables.
- **Dependencies:** Use `deps` to run tasks in order.

### Sample Taskfile snippet

```yaml
version: '3'

vars:
  PROJECT_NAME: MyApp

tasks:
  build:
    desc: "Build the {{.PROJECT_NAME}} application"
    cmds:
      - go build -o ./bin/{{.PROJECT_NAME}} ./cmd/app

  test:
    desc: "Run tests"
    deps: [build]
    cmds:
      - go test ./...

  default:
    desc: "Build and test the application"
    deps: [build, test]
```

This example shows how you can group tasks, create dependencies, and reuse variables.

## 5. Verifying Your Taskfile

To confirm your Taskfile is recognized and working, run:

```shell
task --list
```

You should see a list of available tasks including your newly created ones.

Run the default task to test execution:

```shell
task
```

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Keep it simple at first:** Define only essential tasks and expand as needed.
- **Use descriptive task names and descriptions:** It helps you and your team understand the purpose.
- **Check the YAML syntax carefully:** Misalignment or indentation can cause errors.
- **Keep your Taskfile under version control:** This enables collaboration and history.
- **Use `.dist` variants for shared base templates:** Let individual developers override personal configs.

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Project Initialization">
<Accordion title="Taskfile Not Found">
Ensure your Taskfile is named correctly and placed in the project root. If working in subfolders, Task will search parent dirs, but explicit `--taskfile` flag can specify exact path.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Syntax Errors in Taskfile">
YAML syntax mistakes are common. Use an online YAML validator or a code editor with YAML linting before running Task.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Commands Not Running as Expected">
Verify commands under `cmds` are shell-compatible and paths exist. Use `task --verbose` to see detailed execution output.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflicting Task Names">
Avoid duplicate task names especially if including or flattening multiple Taskfiles. Task will throw errors on conflicts.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Next Steps

After creating your initial Taskfile:

- Proceed to [Your First Task Run](/getting-started/first-steps/first-run) to learn how to execute tasks.
- Review [Basic Configuration & Taskfile Structure](/getting-started/configuration-troubleshooting/configuration-basics) for in-depth Taskfile features.
- Explore advanced [Including and Sharing Taskfiles](/guides/advanced-features-best-practices/including-sharing-taskfiles) to modularize your workflows.
