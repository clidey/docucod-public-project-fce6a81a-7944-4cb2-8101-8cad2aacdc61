# Installation (All Platforms)

Welcome to the comprehensive installation guide for Task, the modern task runner designed to simplify automation across all major operating systems. This document walks you through step-by-step instructions to install Task on Windows, macOS, and Linux using official and community-supported package managers, direct downloads, and build-from-source options. Finally, we'll guide you through verifying your installation to ensure it's ready for your automation workflows.

## 1. Installation Methods Overview

Task offers multiple installation pathways tailored to your environment and preferences. Select the method that fits your OS and use case best.

- **Official Package Managers:** Maintained by the Task team to ensure timely updates.
- **Community-Maintained Package Managers:** Popular but community-supported options.
- **Direct Binaries and Install Scripts:** Quick setup via binary downloads or shell scripts.
- **Build From Source:** For advanced users wanting the latest cutting-edge build.


## 2. Installing Task on Linux

### 2.1 Using Official Package Managers

These instructions use your distribution’s native tooling to install Task.

#### dnf (Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat)

Set up the Cloudsmith repository to get Task packages:

```shell
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/task/task/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

Install Task:

```shell
dnf install task
```

#### apt (Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint)

Configure the repository:

```shell
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/task/task/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

Install Task:

```shell
apt install task
```

#### Arch Linux (pacman)

Task is available in the official Arch repositories:

```shell
pacman -S go-task
```

#### Other Community Options

- **NixOS:**

  ```shell
  nix-env -iA nixpkgs.go-task
  ```

- **FreeBSD Ports:**

  ```shell
  pkg install task
  ```

- **pacstall:**

  ```shell
  pacstall -I go-task-deb
  ```

### 2.2 Using Snap (Linux)

Ensure your distribution supports classic confinement for snaps:

```shell
sudo snap install task --classic
```

### 2.3 Installing Using the Official Install Script

This is an easy, script-driven installer optimized for CI/CD usage.

Run the installer to place Task in the current directory’s `./bin` folder:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d
```

To install to a custom directory, for example your user-local bin folder:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin
```

Specify a particular version by adding its tag after directory arguments:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin v3.42.1
```

> **Warning:** macOS and Windows do not add `~/.local/bin` or `~/bin` to your system PATH by default. You may need to update your shell profile to include these.

### 2.4 Installing From Binary Releases

Download precompiled binaries from the [official GitHub releases](https://github.com/go-task/task/releases).

After downloading, move the binary to a directory in your `$PATH`.

Verify integrity by comparing against the `task_checksums.txt` file.


## 3. Installing Task on macOS

### 3.1 Using Homebrew (Recommended)

To install from Task’s official Homebrew tap:

```shell
brew install go-task/tap/go-task
```

Alternatively, install from the official Homebrew repository:

```shell
brew install go-task
```

### 3.2 Using MacPorts

If you use MacPorts, install Task with:

```shell
port install go-task
```

### 3.3 Using the Official Install Script

Same as Linux, run:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d
```

Specify custom paths or versions as described in the Linux section.

### 3.4 Download Binary Directly

Download the macOS binary from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/go-task/task/releases), place it in `/usr/local/bin` or another `$PATH` directory.


## 4. Installing Task on Windows

### 4.1 Using WinGet (Windows Package Manager)

Run the following to install Task from the community repository:

```shell
winget install Task.Task
```

### 4.2 Using Chocolatey

If you use Chocolatey, install Task with:

```shell
choco install go-task
```

### 4.3 Using Scoop

If you use Scoop:

```shell
scoop install task
```

### 4.4 Using the Official Install Script (WSL or Git Bash)

Run the Linux/macOS install script in a compatible shell with the same parameters:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d
```

### 4.5 Download Binary Directly

Download the Windows executable from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/go-task/task/releases) and add it to your system path.


## 5. Verifying Your Installation

After installation, verify Task is properly installed and accessible.

### Step 1: Check installed version

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```shell
task --version
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
Task vX.Y.Z
```

Where `vX.Y.Z` reflects the installed version.

### Step 2: Confirm command accessibility

Try running the help command:

```shell
task --help
```

This displays usage instructions and confirms the CLI is responsive.

### Step 3: Run a test task

Create a simple `Taskfile.yml` in your current directory with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  hello:
    cmds:
      - echo "Task is successfully installed and running!"
```

Run the task:

```shell
task hello
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
Task is successfully installed and running!
```


## 6. Troubleshooting Installation Issues

### Problem: `task` command not found

- Verify the binary or package installed Task in a directory included in your PATH environment variable.
- On Linux/macOS, run `echo $PATH` and confirm the install directory is listed.
- On Windows, check System Properties &gt; Environment Variables &gt; Path.
- Add the binary path if missing and restart your shell or terminal.

### Problem: Permission denied during install

- For package manager installation, ensure you have administrative or sudo privileges.
- When running install scripts, prefer using `sudo` if permission errors occur.

### Problem: Incorrect version displayed

- The system may have an older Task binary earlier in the PATH.
- Use `which task` (Linux/macOS) or `where task` (Windows) to locate installed copies.
- Remove or rename outdated binaries.

### Problem: Package manager installs outdated Task

- Some Linux distro repositories lag behind the latest versions.
- Use the official install script or binaries for the newest features.
