# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your environment is ready to install and run Task effectively. This guide provides a comprehensive checklist of supported platforms, necessary permissions, and dependencies to avoid common pitfalls and set you up for a smooth automation experience.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

Task is designed for broad cross-platform compatibility, supporting the following operating systems explicitly:

- **Linux** (major distributions)
- **macOS**
- **Windows**

> Task uses system calls and shell execution compatible with these OS families ensuring seamless task runs across environments.

### Platform-Specific Notes

- On **Windows**, PowerShell or Cmd.exe is used as the shell for commands if not explicitly overridden.
- On **Linux** and **macOS**, `/bin/sh` or the default POSIX-compliant shell is used.


## 2. System Requirements

Before installing or running Task, verify your system meets these minimum specifications:

- **Processor:** Any recent x86-64 or ARM architecture compatible with your OS
- **Memory:** Minimum 512 MB RAM (more recommended for complex builds)
- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB free, allowing room for temporary files and caches (`.task` directory)
- **Shell:** A POSIX-compliant shell environment such as `bash`, `sh`, or on Windows, PowerShell/CMD


## 3. Permissions & User Access

- You need permission to execute files and commands in the shell environment.
- File system write permission is required in your project directory to store ephemeral state files in `.task/`.
- If including task files or running tasks that interact with system resources, elevated permissions may be required (e.g., `sudo` on Linux/macOS).


## 4. Dependencies

Task itself is a self-contained binary and does not depend on external runtimes like JVM or Node.js.

However, your tasks (commands inside Taskfiles) may depend on external tools. To successfully run a typical Task installation, make sure:

- Essential system tools used in your task commands are installed (e.g., `git`, `docker`, `make`, compilers).
- The shell environment supports the commands being called.

> Task will run any command in your Taskfile exactly as if typed directly into the terminal.


## 5. Environment Variables and Configuration

- Ensure your shell environment can export and use environment variables, as many Taskfile variables depend on this.
- For `.env` file support, having a standard shell environment to parse and load environment variables is necessary.


## 6. Network and Connectivity

- Network connectivity is not required for Task itself but might be required if your tasks involve remote operations (e.g., package installs, remote builds).
- Make sure any firewall or proxy allows the necessary outbound connections.


## 7. Verification Before Installation

Run the following checks to verify your environment:

```shell
# Check OS and shell
uname -s
# Expected outputs: Linux, Darwin (macOS), or details on Windows

# Check shell available
sh --version || bash --version

# Ensure access to write in current directory
touch testfile && rm testfile

# Confirm presence of basic tools
command -v git || echo "Warning: git not found"
command -v docker || echo "Warning: docker not found"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

### Task Fails to Run
- **Symptom:** "command not found" or binary not executable
- **Solution:** Check binary permissions (`chmod +x ./task`) and ensure your PATH includes the binary location.

### Shell Incompatibility
- **Symptom:** Tasks fail due to unsupported shell commands
- **Solution:** Verify you are running under a supported shell (bash, sh, PowerShell) and adapt your Taskfile commands accordingly.

### Missing Required Tools
- **Symptom:** Individual commands fail (e.g., `docker`, `git` unavailable)
- **Solution:** Install the required external tools as prerequisites for your tasks.

### Permission Denied Writing Files
- **Symptom:** Cannot create or write to `.task` directory or temporary files
- **Solution:** Verify write permissions on your project directory.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Always start from the latest supported version of your OS.
- Confirm the availability of all shell commands your tasks rely on.
- Keep `.task/` directory in your `.gitignore` to prevent ephemeral state from polluting version control.
- Use environment variables or task-level variables to tailor configurations across environments.
- Leverage platform restrictions (`platforms` keyword) in Taskfile to enable conditional task runs.


## Next Steps

Once your environment meets these prerequisites:

1. Proceed to the [Installation (All Platforms)](/getting-started/environment-setup/installation) guide to acquire and set up Task.
2. Explore [Project Initialization](/getting-started/first-steps/project-setup) to create your first Taskfile.
3. Continue to [Your First Task Run](/getting-started/first-steps/first-run) to run a sample task and verify setup.
