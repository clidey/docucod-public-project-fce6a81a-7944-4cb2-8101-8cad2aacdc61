# Quick Feature Overview

Discover a concise snapshot of Task’s most impactful features. This page equips you with a clear understanding of Task’s capabilities, from its robust cross-platform support to advanced dependency and execution controls, enabling you to quickly assess how Task can streamline your automation workflows.

---

## Cross-Platform Support

Task is designed to run seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments without modification to your Taskfiles. This ensures your automation remains consistent and reliable no matter the development platform.

**Why it matters:**
- Develop on one OS and deploy on another without reworking scripts.
- Simplify CI/CD pipelines across heterogeneous build agents.

*Example:* Write a build task once and execute it with confidence on any supported OS.

## Dependency Management

Tasks can declare dependencies, automatically orchestrated by Task to run in the correct sequence before executing the target task.

**Benefits:**
- Automate complex workflows with clear task relationships.
- Avoid manual step tracking and reduce failure from missing prerequisites.

*Example:* A `deploy` task can depend on `build` and `test`, ensuring the latest code is built and validated before deployment.

## Matrix and Loop Constructs

Task supports defining tasks that iterate over a matrix or list of variables to run multiple task variants efficiently.

**Value:**
- Perform bulk operations like testing across multiple environments or building multiple targets in one configuration.
- Avoid repetitive task duplication.

*Example:* Run tests for versions `1.0`, `2.0`, and `3.0` by defining a matrix variable and looping the task execution automatically.

## Conditional Execution

You control whether tasks run through advanced conditional expressions based on environment variables, task status, or custom logic.

**Why this helps:**
- Prevent unnecessary task runs, saving time and resources.
- Implement dynamic workflows that adapt to context.

*Example:* Skip deployment tasks when changes are detected only in documentation files.

## Variable Templating

Task offers powerful variable templating with built-in and user-defined variables that can be injected anywhere within Taskfiles.

**Advantages:**
- Configure reusable, dynamic task definitions.
- Simplify parameterization and customization without duplicating code.

*Example:* Use variables like `{{.TASK}}` or environment variables to tailor commands dynamically during execution.

## Fingerprinting with Status and Sources Checks

Task uses fingerprinting mechanisms to detect if tasks are up-to-date based on their inputs and outputs.

**Impact:**
- Avoid redundant task executions when nothing has changed.
- Improve build speed and efficiency with accurate cache validation.

*Example:* A compile task skips rebuilding if all source files remain unchanged.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- **Keep your Taskfiles readable:** Use clear, concise variable names and task summaries to make complex dependencies understandable.
- **Validate your conditions:** Test conditional expressions carefully to avoid unintentionally skipping critical tasks.
- **Leverage fingerprinting:** Regularly review fingerprint configurations to ensure correct detection of up-to-date status.
- **Use matrices thoughtfully:** Matrix expansions can create many task invocations; monitor CI/CD resource usage accordingly.
