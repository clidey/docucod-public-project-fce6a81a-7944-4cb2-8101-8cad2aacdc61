# Who is Task For? (Audience & Use Cases)

## Unlocking Automation for Every Developer and DevOps Engineer

Task is designed as a flexible and intuitive task runner that meets the needs of a broad spectrum of users involved in software development and operations. Whether you're a developer seeking a streamlined way to automate local development workflows, a DevOps engineer orchestrating CI/CD pipelines, or anyone aiming to simplify cross-platform scripting tasks, Task is built to help you get more done with less hassle.

## Primary Audiences

- **Developers:** Automate repetitive setup, build, test, and code generation tasks locally with clear, maintainable Taskfiles.
- **DevOps Engineers:** Integrate Task into CI/CD pipelines for build automation, testing, and deployment in a way that is easy to configure and extend.
- **System Administrators & Automation Enthusiasts:** Simplify complex scripts across different environments and operating systems, reducing error-prone shell scripting.

## Common Scenarios Where Task Excels

### 1. Development Environment Setup

Developers frequently juggle numerous environment preparation steps: installing dependencies, configuring databases, starting local servers, and running linters or formatters. Task streamlines this with a single source of truth—a Taskfile—that codifies each step clearly and runs them in sequence or in parallel.

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  setup:
    desc: Setup local dev environment
    cmds:
      - task: install-deps
      - task: start-db
      - task: lint

  install-deps:
    cmds:
      - npm install

  start-db:
    cmds:
      - docker-compose up -d db

  lint:
    cmds:
      - npm run lint
```

By running `task setup`, you turn manual, error-prone multi-step instructions into a robust, repeatable command.

### 2. Project Building and Testing

Task makes building your project easier by automating compilation, asset bundling, and running tests with optional watch modes to respond to file changes instantly.

```yaml
tasks:
  build:
    desc: Build the project and assets
    cmds:
      - go build -o ./bin/app ./cmd/app
      - npm run build

  test:
    desc: Run unit tests
    cmds:
      - go test ./...
    watch: true
    sources: ["**/*.go"]
```

Using built-in watches or passing flags like `--watch` accelerates the feedback loop in development.

### 3. Deployment Automation

From packaging releases to pushing images or deploying to cloud services, Task empowers DevOps teams to encode deployment workflows clearly.

```yaml
tasks:
  deploy:
    desc: Deploy app to staging
    preconditions:
      - test -n "$DEPLOY_TOKEN"
    cmds:
      - ./scripts/build-docker.sh
      - docker push myrepo/app:staging
      - ./scripts/notify-deployment.sh
```

Precondition checks ensure that deployments only proceed when critical variables are set, reducing costly mistakes.

### 4. Cross-Platform Script Simplification

Instead of writing separate shell, PowerShell, or batch scripts, use Task’s platform-specific conditions to maintain a single automation workflow across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

```yaml
tasks:
  install-tool:
    cmds:
      - cmd: choco install mytool
        platforms: [windows]
      - cmd: brew install mytool
        platforms: [darwin]
      - cmd: apt-get install -y mytool
        platforms: [linux]
```

This allows teams to share automation effortlessly, eliminating platform fragmentation.

## Why Choose Task?

- **Simplicity:** Easy-to-read YAML Taskfiles replace complex shell scripts and Makefiles.
- **Flexibility:** Supports dependencies, variables, includes, environment management, and conditional logic.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Built-in platform constraints ensure tasks run only where intended.
- **Integration-Ready:** Fits naturally into CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows.
- **User-Centric Workflows:** Designed around how users think about their automation tasks rather than internal tool mechanics.

## Imagine Your Workflow Without Task

- Wasting time rewiring complex Makefiles or shell scripts every time your project changes.
- Struggling with inconsistent commands between team members’ environments.
- Manually coordinating multi-step build or deploy sequences.

## With Task, Everything Flows Seamlessly

- Run a single command to set up your environment or kick off full builds.
- Share Taskfiles that work uniformly across different OSes.
- Integrate with CI tools effortlessly using the same automation definitions you use locally.
