# Upgrade Guides

Practical advice and stepwise instructions to update your Task installation and adapt your Taskfiles or automation pipelines. This guide helps ensure a smooth transition when upgrading Task across versions, highlighting deprecations, migration paths, and new recommended practices.

---

## 1. Preparing for an Upgrade

Upgrading Task is straightforward but requires understanding of versioning changes, deprecated features, and compatibility considerations to avoid disruptions in automation.

- **Always review the changelog and breaking changes documentation before upgrading.**
- **Back up your current Taskfiles and automation environment.**
- **Test upgrades in a controlled environment before applying to production pipelines.**

This preparation minimizes surprises and ensures your workflows continue running flawlessly.

---

## 2. Understanding Versioning and Compatibility

Task uses semantic versioning (semver) with versions structured as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Understanding what each increment means helps you assess upgrade impact:

- **Major versions** (e.g., v2.x to v3.x): May introduce breaking changes requiring Taskfile or usage migration.
- **Minor versions** (e.g., v3.44 to v3.45): Add features and improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Patch versions** (e.g., v3.45.3 to v3.45.4): Contain bug fixes and minor updates without breaking changes.

Refer to the [Version Timeline](https://taskfile.dev/docs/changelog/release-history/version-timeline) for historical releases and mappings.

## 3. Migrating Taskfiles and Adoption Steps

### 3.1 Identify Breaking Changes

Check the [Breaking Changes & Migration Notes](https://taskfile.dev/docs/changelog/upgrade-guides/breaking-changes) to identify features removed or changed since your current version. Examples include:

- Deprecated schema versions (e.g., removal of `version: 2` schema in v3.34.0)
- Changes to variable syntax, platform support, or task includes
- Renamed or removed CLI flags

### 3.2 Update Taskfile Syntax and Features

- Adapt your Taskfiles to the latest supported schema version.
- Replace deprecated syntax or keywords according to migration notes.
- Adjust any includes, namespaces, or variables that are affected.

### 3.3 Leverage New Features

Adopt new capabilities to improve automation efficiency and maintainability:

- Use enhanced wildcard and matrix looping features.
- Update to latest variable and templating engine improvements.
- Utilize new output modes and concurrency controls where appropriate.

### 3.4 Test Thoroughly

- Run your Taskfiles with `--dry` or `--list` to verify task definitions.
- Validate output correctness and dependency execution order.
- Check task logs and outputs for warnings or errors.

## 4. Installation and Upgrade Methods

### 4.1 Updating Your Task Installation

Depending on your platform, choose an appropriate upgrade method:

- **Homebrew (macOS/Linux):** `brew upgrade go-task`
- **Snap (Linux):** Update via Snapcraft dashboard as described in [Releasing](https://taskfile.dev/docs/cmd/releasing)
- **npm:** Update using `npm install -g @go-task/cli` or `pnpm`
- **Winget (Windows):** Manually update manifest and push pull requests as per [Winget instructions](https://taskfile.dev/docs/cmd/releasing)
- **Manual build:** Rebuild from source using Go (`go install ./cmd/task@latest`)

### 4.2 Version Pinning & Local Testing

- Use version-specific tags or commit hashes for reproducing older or specific builds.
- Employ nightly or beta releases for early testing of upcoming features or fixes.

---

## 5. Adapting Automation Pipelines

### 5.1 Update CI/CD Configurations

- Update pipeline references to use the new Task binary.
- Adjust commands invoking Task to use any new CLI flags or environment variables.

### 5.2 Environment Variables & .taskrc Usage

- Transition to the new global config via `.taskrc.yml` as introduced in recent versions.
- Review environment variable precedence especially for `TASK_OFFLINE` and caching behaviors.

### 5.3 Modular and Remote Taskfiles Considerations

- Check checksum pinning for included remote Taskfiles.
- Review inclusion flattening and namespaces for compatibility.

---

## 6. Deprecations and Removed Features

Stay informed about removed features that might impact your setup:

- Deprecated schema versions and unsupported loaders
- Removal of deprecated completion scripts in favor of new `--completion` flag
- Changes in variable scoping and special variable behaviors
- Adjusted behaviors for fingerprinting and status commands

Refer to [Deprecations](https://taskfile.dev/docs/changelog/detail-changes/deprecations) for details.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Upgrade Issues

Common pain points and solutions:

- **Unexpected task failures:** Check for missing or altered variable references; run with `--verbose` for insights.
- **Incorrect platform detection:** Confirm `platforms:` settings and Task version compatibility.
- **Broken includes or missing dependencies:** Verify checksum pins and refresh remote caches if applicable.
- **Performance regressions:** Use new CLI flags like `--no-status` to optimize scanning overhead.

Refer to [Troubleshooting & Validation](https://taskfile.dev/docs/getting-started/configuration-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-common) for general guidance.

---

## 8. Best Practices for Smooth Upgrades

- Keep Task installation and Taskfiles in version control.
- Use automated CI tests to verify Taskfile functionality after upgrades.
- Follow semantic version constraints in automation tooling.
- Monitor Task's changelog and blog for release announcements.
- Experiment with new features in non-critical branches before rolling out globally.
