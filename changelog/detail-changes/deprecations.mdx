# Deprecation Notices

This page gathers announcements and guidance regarding features, Taskfile schema versions, and APIs that are marked as deprecated. Keeping abreast of these notices ensures you can proactively plan migrations and adjust your workflows beyond the immediate moment, safeguarding your automation tasks against disruption caused by removed or altered functionality.

## Understanding Deprecations in Task

As Task evolves, some features become outdated or replaced by improved alternatives. Deprecations signal upcoming removals or significant changes in functionality, giving you a clear heads-up to avoid reliance on soon-to-be-unsupported elements.

This notice system helps you:

- Identify features, commands, or schema versions that will no longer receive updates or support.
- Plan migration paths to newer patterns with stability guarantees.
- Prevent sudden breaks in automation by adapting your Taskfiles and scripts early.

<Check>
Proactively monitoring deprecation notices is essential for maintaining reliable and future-proof automation flows.

## Current Active Deprecations

### Version 2 Schema (#1197)

::: danger

This deprecation breaks the following functionality:

- All Taskfiles using Version 2 of the Taskfile schema
- Files named `Taskvar.yml`

:::

The Taskfile version 2 schema has been deprecated in favor of version 3 since August 2019. Final support for version 2 was removed in Task v3.33.0 (December 2023).

### What this means for you

- Existing Taskfiles using version 2 schema will no longer function with versions of Task beyond v3.33.0.
- Any direct references to `Taskvar.yml` files must be replaced.

### Migration path

- Upgrade your Taskfiles to version 3 schema following the [Task v3 Release Notes](https://github.com/go-task/task/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
- Review changes between v2 and v3 schemas to adapt your Automation workflows.

### Template Functions Deprecation

::: danger

This deprecation breaks the following functionality:

- A small subset of templating functions

:::

Certain templating functions have been deprecated to simplify and unify the templating engine. Examples include:

| Deprecated Function | Replacement    |
|---------------------|----------------|
| `IsSH`              | (No replacement) |
| `FromSlash`         | `fromSlash`     |
| `ToSlash`           | `toSlash`       |
| `ExeExt`            | `exeExt`        |

### Recommended actions

- Replace any occurrences of deprecated functions with their counterparts listed above.
- If a function has no replacement, refactor your template logic accordingly.

---

### Completion Scripts Deprecation

::: danger

This deprecation breaks the following functionality:

- Any direct use of completion scripts stored in the Task Git repository under `completion/*`.

:::

Direct references to completion scripts in the Task repository are deprecated due to potential movement or removal.

### What to do

- Switch to the new [shell completion generation method](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation#setup-completions) for safe and future-proof integration.
- Update your shell configuration files to remove direct script references.
