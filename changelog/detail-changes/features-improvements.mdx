## Recent Releases: Highlights and Value

### v3.45.4 - 2025-09-17

- **Bug Fixes for Configuration and Autocomplete**
  - Fixed issues with defining `cache-expiry` in the `.taskrc.yml` configuration file.
  - Corrected the recursive reading of `.taskrc.yml` files in parent directories.
  - Resolved autocomplete failures in zsh when working in subfolders.

### v3.45.3 - 2025-09-15

- **Built-in Core Utilities on Windows**
  Task now bundles common UNIX core utilities (e.g., `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`) on Windows. This eliminates the need for extra setup for these commands and significantly improves Windows compatibility.
  - Read the dedicated blog post for detailed guidance: [Windows Core Utilities](https://taskfile.dev/blog/windows-core-utils).

- **New Website Powered By VitePress**
  Improved documentation experience with a modern framework providing enhanced navigation and faster loading.

- **Nightly Builds Introduced**
  Users can now access cutting-edge builds before general release, simplifying early testing without building from source.

- **Global Configuration Support**
  Support was added for global `.taskrc.yml` config files located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/task` or `$HOME`, providing consistent behavior across projects.

- **Expanded `.taskrc.yml` Features and Properties**
  New configuration settings like `insecure`, `verbose`, `concurrency`, and improved remote features (`offline`, `timeout`, `expiry`) were added.
  - Note: Offline mode via environment variable is deprecated.

- **Enhanced Task Listing with `--nested` Flag**
  The `--list --json` output now supports nested task structures, reflecting namespaces and providing a clearer overview.

- **Improved Wildcard Task Support**
  Wildcards are better logged and integrated with fingerprinting, making dynamic task targeting more robust.

### Package API Updates

- Minimum Go version raised to 1.24 to leverage modern language features and ensure future sustainability.

### Other Noteworthy Updates

- Official release of the GitHub Action `setup-task` for easier integration in CI workflows.
