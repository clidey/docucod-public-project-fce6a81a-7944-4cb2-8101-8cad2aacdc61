## Best Practices for Managing Bug Fix Updates

- **Review Changelogs Regularly:** Before upgrading, check this page to understand fixed issues relevant to your workflows.
- **Test in Staging:** Apply the latest patches in controlled environments to catch regressions early.
- **Keep Task Up-to-Date:** Frequent updates reduce exposure to known bugs and benefit from ongoing stability improvements.
- **Report Persistent Issues:** If a fixed bug recurs or you encounter new issues, contribute feedback to maintainers.


## Troubleshooting Common Bug Symptoms

- Unexpected task failures or silent skips — Check for fixes related to fingerprinting and conditional execution.
- Incorrect variable values or template errors — Look for recent fixes around variable handling and dynamic evaluation.
- Task list anomalies or completion issues — Review bug patches for CLI flags and shell integration.
- Performance degradation during file watching — Investigate watcher-related fixes.

If you encounter unexpected behavior after updating, verify if it relates to a regression detailed here and consider rolling back or reporting it.
