# Version Timeline

Welcome to the Version Timeline page, your comprehensive guide to browsing all Task releases in sequence. Here, every version is documented with its release date and a headline summary so you can quickly orient yourself with the evolution of Task, understand notable new features or fixes, and make informed decisions about upgrading.

## Understanding the Version Timeline

This page serves as a chronological catalog of Task releases, presented in reverse chronological order (newest first). Each entry provides:

- The exact version number following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- The official release date
- A concise executive summary highlighting major changes, new features, improvements, bug fixes, or deprecations

By scanning the timeline, you can easily spot milestones and identify which version aligns with the features or fixes you require.

## Versioning and Release Structure

### Semantic Versioning

Task follows semantic versioning rules with Versions expressed as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. For example:

- **MAJOR**: Introduces incompatible API or schema changes
- **MINOR**: Adds functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

The timeline documents versions accordingly, helping you understand the significance of upgrades at a glance.

### Release Types

- **Major releases** often introduce new schema versions or deprecations (e.g., v3.x.0)
- **Minor releases** add new features or enhancements
- **Patch releases** focus on bug fixes and optimizations

### Release Dates

Each entry includes the date the release was officially published, enabling correlation to your environment and deployment cycles.
