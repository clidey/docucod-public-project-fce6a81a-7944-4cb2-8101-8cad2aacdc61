# Environment Management & .env Files

Task empowers you to manage your system and project-specific environments effectively, enabling consistent, reproducible automation workflows. This guide unpacks how Task integrates with environment variables, supports `.env` files, and orchestrates environment variable precedence to create portable and reliable build environments.

---

## Understanding Environment Management in Task

Environment variables serve as a cornerstone for controlling task behavior without hardcoding values. Task supports multiple layers of environment configuration that work together fluidly:

- **System Environment Variables:** Variables defined in your OS shell
- **Environment Section in Taskfile:** Static variables declared under `env` at the global or task level
- **`.env` Files:** Loading environment variables from key-value files
- **Command-Level Overrides:** Variables defined in task execution or included Taskfiles

When you run a task, Task merges these sources thoughtfully, favoring the closest or explicitly set values to ensure your automation runs with the correct context.

### Why Environment Management Matters

Consider a cross-platform build task that requires API keys, URLs, or feature toggles. You don’t want to embed secrets or environment details into the Taskfile directly. Instead, environment management lets you: 

- Keep sensitive data out of source control
- Switch between development, staging, and production settings effortlessly
- Ensure tasks behave as expected regardless of the host system

## Loading and Using `.env` Files

Task supports loading environment variables from `.env` files within both global and task contexts. This feature allows for standardized environment setups across projects.

### How `.env` Files Work

A `.env` file contains lines of key-value pairs, for example:

```env
API_KEY=1234567890abcdef
DEBUG=true
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/db
```

In Taskfiles, you can specify one or more `.env` files to load using the `dotenv` field either globally or per task:

```yaml
version: '3'
dotenv:
  - '.env'

tasks:
  build:
    dotenv:
      - 'build.env'
    cmds:
      - echo "$API_KEY"
```

When executed, Task reads these files, merges their values, and injects them into the task environment.

### Variable Precedence within `.env` Files

Task only sets variables from `.env` files if they are not already present in the environment or overridden by explicit `env` or `vars` declarations. This means your shell environment variables will take precedence over `.env` entries unless experimental flags alter the behavior.

### Practical Tips for `.env` Usage

- Use `.env` files for sensitive and environment-specific variables to avoid hardcoding.
- You can declare multiple `.env` files in order; later files can override earlier ones.
- When running tasks locally, double-check that your shell environment does not unintentionally override `.env` variables.
- For dynamic `.env` file paths, you can use vars templating:

```yaml
vars:
  DOTENV_FILE: '.env.dev'

tasks:
  start:
    dotenv:
      - '{{.DOTENV_FILE}}'
    cmds:
      - echo "$DATABASE_URL"
```

## How Environment Variables Are Merged and Prioritized

Understanding how Task resolves and prioritizes environment variables helps avoid confusion and ensures predictable task execution.

### Environment Variable Sources and Their Priority

1. **Task Execution Call Environment:** Variables set externally in your terminal session or CI environment.
2. **Taskfile `env` Section:** Variables explicitly defined under `env` in your Taskfile (global or per task).
3. **`.env` File Variables:** Loaded from the `.env` files specified.
4. **Task `vars` and Command `vars`:** These are primarily used for interpolation but can influence environment variables indirectly.

In practice, Task preserves your shell environment variables first, then applies `env` variables, and finally falls back on `.env` file values if no conflicts occur.

### Environment Variable Example Behavior

Consider this Taskfile snippet:

```yaml
version: '3'
env:
  GREETING: "Hello from global env"
dotenv:
  - '.env'

tasks:
  greet:
    env:
      GREETING: "Hello from task env"
    dotenv:
      - 'special.env'
    cmds:
      - echo "$GREETING"
```

Assuming `.env` contains `GREETING=Hello from .env` and `special.env` contains `GREETING=Hello from special.env`, when you run `task greet`, the output would be:

```
Hello from task env
```

Because the task-level `env` overrides `.env` file values.

## Strategies for Portable and Reproducible Environments

Robust automation requires predictable, portable environments that behave consistently across machines and CI systems.

### Best Practices

- **Commit `.env.example` Files:** Provide scaffold `.env` files with placeholders highlighting expected variables without secrets.
- **Use `.env` Files for Sensitive and Environment-Specific Values:** Keep these out of Taskfiles to reduce leakage of secrets or system-specific info.
- **Explicitly Declare Required Environment Variables:** Use preconditions or validation to catch missing variables early (see [Conditional Execution & Preconditions](https://go-task.github.io/guides/advanced-features-best-practices/conditional-execution-preconditions/)).
- **Avoid Overriding System Environment Variables Unintentionally:** Let environment variables from the OS take precedence to adapt across environments unless an explicit override is necessary.
- **Leverage Namespaced Includes:** Pass variables to included Taskfiles to isolate environments cleanly (see [Including and Sharing Taskfiles](https://go-task.github.io/guides/advanced-features-best-practices/including-sharing-taskfiles/)).

### Example: Creating a Portable Build Environment Using `.env`

```yaml
version: '3'
dotenv:
  - '.env'

tasks:
  build:
    cmds:
      - echo "Building project with URL: $API_URL"
      - ./build.sh
```

Your `.env` file:

```env
API_URL=https://staging.example.com/api
```

This setup allows any user or CI runner to replicate the environment without changing the Taskfile.

## Environment Variable Injection Flow

Below is a conceptual flow illustrating how environment variables are collected and merged during task execution:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph "System Environment"
    SYS_ENV["OS Environment Variables"]
  end

  subgraph "Taskfile"
    GLOBAL_ENV["Global env Section"]
    DOTENV_FILES["Loaded .env Files"]
    TASK_ENV["Task env Section"]
  end

  SYS_ENV -->|Highest Priority| MERGE_ENV["Merged Environment"]
  GLOBAL_ENV --> MERGE_ENV
  DOTENV_FILES --> MERGE_ENV
  TASK_ENV --> MERGE_ENV

  MERGE_ENV --> RUN_TASK["Execute Task with Environment"]
```

This flow ensures the most explicit and immediate environment settings dominate, while still leveraging `.env` files for fallback configuration.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Tips for Troubleshooting Environment Issues">
<Accordion title="Task Not Picking Up .env Variables">
- Ensure the `.env` file path is correct and accessible.
- Make sure the `dotenv` field is properly declared in your Taskfile or task.
- Verify that `.env` file syntax follows `KEY=VALUE` format without quotes or spaces.
- Run `task --debug` to see loaded environment variables.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Environment Variables Not Overridden as Expected">
- Remember your shell environment variables take precedence unless the experimental flag to invert precedence is enabled.
- Check for conflicting declarations in `env` sections or command-level overrides.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Variable Interpolation Confusion">
- Variables under `vars` are for interpolation in the Taskfile YAML, not for environment injection.
- Use the `env` section to explicitly set environment variables, or load them via `.env` files.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
